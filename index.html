	<div class="header4">
			
			Energy is an issue that touches every person on the planet.That's why National Geographic, in partnership with Shell*, has launched the Great Energy Challenge.
			The Great Energy Challenge convenes and engages influential citizens and key energy stakeholders in solutions-based thinking and dialogue about our shared energy future.It's a call to action to become actively involved, to learn more and do more—to change how we think about and consume energy so that we can all help tackle the big energy questions. National Geographic has assembled some of the world's foremost researchers and scientists to help address the challenge. Led by Thomas Lovejoy, a National Geographic conservation fellow and renowned biologist, the team of advisors will work together to identify and provide support for projects focused on innovative energy solutions.<a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/energy/great-energy-challenge/about/">Read More</a>

		<div class="header5">
				The planet is warming, from North Pole to South Pole, and everywhere in between. Globally, the mercury is already up more than 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius), and even more in sensitive polar regions. And the effects of rising temperatures aren’t waiting for some far-flung future. They’re happening right now. Signs are appearing all over, and some of them are surprising. The heat is not only melting glaciers and sea ice, it’s also shifting precipitation patterns and setting animals on the move.<a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-effects/">Read More</a>

				Climate change will have a significant impact on the sustainability of water supplies in the coming decades. A new analysis, performed by consulting firm Tetra Tech for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), examined the effects of global warming on water supply and demand in the contiguous United States. The study found that more than 1,100 counties -- one-third of all counties in the lower 48 -- will face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming. More than 400 of these counties will face extremely high risks of water shortages.Heat waves, wildfires, floods and droughts hit us hard in 2012 (the warmest year on record for the United States).

						<h4 id="six"> How Dust Might Make Drought Worse <button>Click Me</button> </h4>
		
		<div class="header6">
				California's water comes from the snow stored in the Sierra Nevada each winter. In the spring, melting snow helps fill the state's reservoirs for the dry summer. (Read "When the Snows Fail" in National Geographic magazine.
				As the state's historic drought drags on, scientists are watching the Sierra snow with intense interest—and they're worrying that even tiny airborne particles of dust may have a big effect on water supplies.
				Here's how: As California gets drier, it's getting dustier, and at least some of that dust is landing in the Sierra. Dusty snow, with its darker surface, absorbs more solar radiation than clean snow does, meaning it heats up faster and melts more quickly..<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140925-california-drought-dust-snowpack-snowmelt-climate-science-environment/">Read More</a>
